# Weights

Large `.pth` files are excluded from normal git history (`*.pth`) and exceed standard GitHub file-size recommendations.

Use `weights_manifest.json` to verify downloaded weights.

Expected files:
- `transunet_glaucoma_best.pth`
- `efficientnet_dr_best.pth`
- `unet_r34_drive_best.pth`

Recommended distribution:
- GitHub Release assets
- Kaggle Dataset artifacts
- Google Drive links in README
